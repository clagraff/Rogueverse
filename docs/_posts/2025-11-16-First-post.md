It ain't much, but it's a start....

![first-post.gif]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/first-post.gif)

I am hoping that by running a small blog to document my progress along this journey I want to embark on, I might
be able to better reflect on what I am doing, where I am going, and how I am doing.

## Elevator Pitch

`Rogueverse` is a top-down roguelike where you explore planets, derelicts, and your own ship, on foot or at the helm, in
a galaxy shaped by emergent systems and meaningful choices.

I want to have the game have
[c.u.r.s.e.d.](https://youtu.be/i3vA-EE4HwE?si=ul1c4lPO_AXkrH97&t=129) mechanics; crafting, survival, open-world. Craft
weapons, armor, and gear. Explore an open galaxy of planents, asteroids, ships, and more. Engage in combat, trading,
questing, and the like. Be a pacifist. Be a monster. Be whatever you want.

Blending elements from several games, but noteably [ASCII Sector](https://www.asciisector.net/) for its
travel mechanics, Minecraft for its building/crafting, and Starfield for its setting & design.

## Where we're at

The game is... not a game yet. A proof-of-concept at most. Built with flutter and flame, as of this posting
all I've done is establish some basics for the engine, and can get a few visuals on the screen with some minor controls.

But it is a start, and I hope to have something to show for it soon. 

## Were we've been

This is not my first attempt at this project. Or my second. Or third... I've tried to _start_ several
times, made various attempts, but never got far. I might not with this iteration either.

Previous attempts had a... more interesting focus. I wanted the game to by multiplayer from the get-go.
I'd tried writing it in Golang + Ebiten a few different times, but never got too far. I am hoping 
with my lack of emphasis on the multiplayer front, I might have a better shot at building something.

## Where we're going

What _exactly_ do I want from this game?

I do want to lean into the older ASCII-style aesthetics; in part because I cannot design visuals if
my life depended on it, but also because I believe the simplistic graphics can help make way to more complex
gameplay mechanics.

I want to have a fun, open-world, top-down roguelike where you can explore, craft, and battle. Hop in your
spaceship, fly between planents and asteroids, engage in space dog-fights, and go land and start exploring again.

I want simple-yet-fun gameplay loops around resource gathering, crafting and upgrading gear, and engaging
in the local economy of the areas you explore.

I also want something a bit more niche... programmable player characters. The idea of being able to 
wire-up behavior trees for, say, party members or even your main character has always been an interesting
idea to me, and something I'd love to explore as part of this project.

I hope to have something to show for it soon.
